When "Position" changed to "Infield", it asks to 
- select "Size"
- Select Thumb color
- Select Index finger color
- Select Middler finger color etc

When "Position" changed to "Catcher", it asks to 
- select "Catcher Mitt Size"
- Select "Shell back color"
- Select "Rails color" etc.

Similarly, when "Finger Pad" is set to "Yes", "Finger Pad Color" and "Finger Pad Location" are asked to select.

1. Please let me know if only these Options are for personalization:
   - Wrist Logo Options
   - Thumb Logo
   - Name Font
   - Special Instructions


2. Can you have both thumb logo and thumb text? If yes, any example of thumb logo and thumb text together?

3. Will "Thumb Logo Color" be valid only if customer has selected "E Logo"?

4. Are "Name on Thumb", "Name Font" and "Name Color" related to thumb text?
