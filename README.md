When "Position" changed to "Infield", it asks to 
- select "Size"
- Select Thumb color
- Select Index finger color
- Select Middler finger color etc

When "Position" changed to "Catcher", it asks to 
- select "Catcher Mitt Size"
- Select "Shell back color"
- Select "Rails color" etc.

Similarly, when "Finger Pad" is set to "Yes", "Finger Pad Color" and "Finger Pad Location" are asked to select.

Since this already have been implemented on your website, you must be having all these "conditions" with you.
Could you please share them? 


We are looking to add these 12 leather colors for steerhide and 4 colors for Kip. Will you need pngs for each glove piece and view or can you make them on your side with the files you have?
