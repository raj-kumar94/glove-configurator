https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52958481/cloning-nodes-and-appending-to-separate-layers-in-react-konva

When "Position" changed to "Infield", it asks to 
- select "Size"
- Select Thumb color
- Select Index finger color
- Select Middler finger color etc

When "Position" changed to "Catcher", it asks to 
- select "Catcher Mitt Size"
- Select "Shell back color"
- Select "Rails color" etc.

Similarly, when "Finger Pad" is set to "Yes", "Finger Pad Color" and "Finger Pad Location" are asked to select.

Since this already have been implemented on your website, you must be having all these "conditions" with you.
Could you please share them?
