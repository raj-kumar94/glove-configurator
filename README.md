## Dynamic height for material ui tab containers
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47095900/dynamic-height-for-material-ui-tab-containers

When "Position" changed to "Infield", it asks to 
- select "Size"
- Select Thumb color
- Select Index finger color
- Select Middler finger color etc

When "Position" changed to "Catcher", it asks to 
- select "Catcher Mitt Size"
- Select "Shell back color"
- Select "Rails color" etc.

Similarly, when "Finger Pad" is set to "Yes", "Finger Pad Color" and "Finger Pad Location" are asked to select.

Since this already have been implemented on your website, you must be having all these "conditions" with you.
Could you please share them? 


We are looking to add these 12 leather colors for steerhide and 4 colors for Kip. Will you need pngs for each glove piece and view or can you make them on your side with the files you have?

# Text
- Thumb



1. Please let me know if only these Options are for personalization:
   - Wrist Logo Options
   - Thumb Logo
   - Name Font
   - Special Instructions


2. Can you have both thumb logo and thumb text? If yes, any example of thumb logo and thumb text together?

3. Will "Thumb Logo Color" be valid only if customer has selected "E Logo"?

4. Are "Name on Thumb", "Name Font" and "Name Color" related to thumb text?


I see 44 is letting select either Hood or Pad, not both. Do you offer both?
Also, I tried searching for images for Pad, but couldn't find in the folder. Could you please check?


-----------
piping color is missing from the website



# TODO
- color option on selection of "Wrist Logo Options"

- Update color pallet
- Update n remaining text
- Add Thumb text
- Add thumb custom logo
- Rename piping to binding
- Finger Pad color doesn’t seem to be working when selected



# Doc
controls[option].activate -> string | array
controls[option].deactivate -> string | array

All glove templates should start as the same color white
- I see that som


- only finger pad or hood color will be visible at a time
- Removed Selection of yes or no for finger pad or hood as it was ambigious
- Stitch color for pad/hood will be same as of main stitching color

# Wrist Options - when customer selects “One Piece” we need to remove the stitching that separates wrist from thumb
-> In this case designer has to seperate stitches. Please check the current stich image in the attachment

# Wrist Logo Options - glove template doesn’t change when “Embroidery” “Patch Embroidery” or “Patch Stamped” is selected
Please let me know if these are true
- when none is selected, there won't be any logo
- when Embroidery is selected, only logo will appear
- when Patch Embroidery is selected, both patch and logo will appear

But what happens when Patch Stamped is selected? I can't find any image having "stamp" in it.
